To help you do that, I have tried to boil down the advice of good writers and editors to some tested guidelines. There are few rules in writing many guidelines, but only a few rules. I have three rules: no blasphemy, no obscenity, and no dishonesty.

“Writing, the art of communicating thoughts to the mind through the eye, is the great invention of the world...enabling us to converse with the dead, the absent, and the unborn, at all distances of time and space.”

**Writing Skills—The Basics**

We will start by looking back. If your English level is at or above the "Band 4" level, most of the writing you have done for teachers or exams could be considered academic paragraphs or academic essays. After reviewing basic academic writing, we can build on that foundation.

The paragraph is the basic building block of any good writing. As a language student, you need this building block to answer exam essay questions, complete basic assignments, and construct larger academic essays (to be covered in lesson 4). In an academic context, a paragraph is a group of sentences presenting a single idea through connected facts, arguments, or descriptions.

**1.2a. Introduction, body and conclusion (and sample outline)**

An academic paragraph has three parts: introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction and conclusion are each one sentence long. The body should be two to four sentences. Tie your introduction, body and conclusion together by repeating the main concepts (preferably by using a similar word or phrase instead of the same wording).

Your topic sentence (i.e., your introduction) is very important because it gets the reader's attention or at least tells him/her what you will write about. Begin your paragraph with something interesting. A good topic sentence makes the reader want to read on.

Next, the body gives evidence or details that develop your point in an interesting way. We’ll talk more about this later (especially in 3.2, "How to Begin"), but for now just remember to make sure everything in your body is related to your topic sentence. To keep it interesting, use a variety of sentence structures and avoid starting multiple sentences with the same word.

Finally, conclude by summarizing your support and/or stating an important consequence or implication of your argument. Be sure to restate your topic (this does NOT mean simply repeating your topic sentence!). A good way to think of an implication is to try to answer this question from your reader's perspective: "Why does this matter to me?" While the topic sentence and conclusion contain similar information, they also need to sound different. The former previews your idea; the conclusion summarizes your idea with more details (i.e., with the support you used in the body).

**General academic paragraph (sample outline)**

- **Topic sentence**
  - The first sentence introduces the topic
- **Body of the paragraph**
  - Two or three sentences that provide support or details to develop your point
- **Summary/conclusion**
  - The final sentence summarizes your support and/or provides some important implication related to the topic sentence

**1.2b. Written versus spoken English, and things to avoid**

Remember that academic writing is different from spoken English, or even from conversational writing. In each of these, the goal is communication, but written English needs to be concise and logically organized while spoken English has much more repetition and wordiness (often in order to be courteous). Furthermore, most conversational writing seeks to influence the reader, but writers need to think of academic graders as objective observers (not personal readers). In academic writing, be sure the word *you* means "you all" not "you individually." In fact, the word *you* is much less common in academic work than in most forms of writing.

Spoken English is also more personal. Most academic work is about something you can study or describe—not personal experiences—so try to leave out personal references such as *I, my,* and *our.* For example, the topic "sports on campus" would make a better academic essay than "my favorite sport." Similarly, personal exclamations (like "What a happy group!") almost never appear in academic writing.

When you write (and especially when you write an academic topic sentence or conclusion), you also need to avoid several **vague** or polite **colloquial expressions**, including: *please, everyone knows, etc.*

- **"Please take your friends seriously and learn to..."** Please is an important and polite oral expression, but in writing you convince readers with facts and support, not politeness. Another reason to avoid *please* is because *please* means "you individually need to do something," and this personal tone is not appropriate for academic writing.
- **"As everyone knows..."** *"It is clear that..." "It is safe to say..."* This kind of vague expression does not belong in your writing for two reasons: (1) if it is "needless to say" something, then there is no need to state it, and (2) there is probably someone who doesn’t know—or doesn’t agree with—what "everybody knows." Poor writers use such phrases to make their opinions sound convincing, when they should be convincing their readers with *facts* or clear examples.
- **"Cake, candles and so on are important..."** *"Friends are something like books."* Vague terms such as "something like," "etc.," or "and so on" just make it sound like the writer doesn’t know what is important enough to write down. Learn to be more specific.

**1.2c. Writing a good title and a lean paragraph**

Writing a good *title* for your essay is hard work. It needs to be simple yet interesting. Don’t just state the topic; add a detail or two. (Compare the vague title "Birthday Celebrations" with the more informative "70th Birthday Celebrations in Zhejiang.") Most titles (other than news) do not contain verbs. The title should be something your sentences can support or explain, not a <u>colloquial expression</u> ("New Mood Comes with Campus Repairs" is clear, while this title says nothing: "This Place is Well on the Way"). Sometimes a thought-provoking question is appropriate (e.g., "Summer Jobs: Helpful or Harmful?"). Book and newspaper titles try to attract a reader’s attention, but a grader reading academic essays (e.g., your teacher) is looking for a thoughtfully-written summary. Leave a space between your title and first sentence; type-written titles should not be in a bigger font.

If you choose your words wisely you can write a great paragraph with less than 150 words. The key is in writing a good topic sentence, and then sticking to your subject. Remember that graders want to find out what you know and how you express this, not whether or not your grandpa had a nice birthday party. Once you master the lean paragraph, you can move into longer paragraphs without boring your reader.

Look carefully at the following example. It starts with a good title, the topic sentence introduces the subject well, the support is presented as three "steps," and the conclusion summarizes the support while presenting an implication (that the celebration is happy). Notice that even though the author is probably writing about a personal experience, she gives it an academic tone by keeping out personal references. Also notice that it needs only 101 words; good writers don’t need hundreds of words to make a point.

**70th Birthday Celebrations in Zhejiang** *(by Kris)*

People in Zhejiang like to hold a three-step, family celebration on their 70th birthdays. First, all the family members attend a gathering to discuss the details of the celebration. Then there is a ceremony party. The honored guest always wears a traditional "Tang Zhuang" with the Chinese character *shou* (long-life) on it. Young people give their best wishes to the elder and the elder gives red envelopes containing money to them. After that, a reception for the guests is held; often, excellent food is served. Family participation and a special dinner party make 70th birthday celebrations in Zhejiang a happy time. (101 words)

**1.2d. Better writing tip: don’t be vague**

Vague writing is boring writing. These basic guidelines will make your writing stronger.

1. **Avoid the word "good"** (replace it with something more specific).
2. **Don’t start many sentences with "It is..." or "There are..."**
   - Weak: "It is good to study abroad."
   - Better: "Studying abroad can provide many opportunities, such as..."
   - Weak: "There are two advantages to studying abroad."
   - Better: "The two major advantages of studying abroad are..."
3. **Include a preview in your topic sentence, not a vague expression like "in many ways"**
   - Weak: "Studying abroad can help students in many ways."
   - Better: "Studying abroad can help students by giving them broader insight and more knowledge." or "Studying abroad can give students broader insight and more knowledge."

**1.2e. The personal paragraph**

Before ending this lesson, let's look at the *personal* paragraph. Most academic work is better without personal references (like *I, my,* and *our*), but students also have to write summaries of special experiences or assignments, and many students write a Personal Statement while seeking entry into graduate school. Even though such writing must include personal pronouns, don’t overdo it—keep the focus on your content. If you are writing about a personal experience you may need *I/my* in just about every sentence, but if you are writing about "my hometown" then two or three personal pronouns should be enough. A good rule is to either use personal references more than once or not at all.

The outline for a personal paragraph is the same as for an academic paragraph. Notice that the conclusion (in the following example) includes a summary and an implication. This is important because readers want to know what the student *did* during her internship, but evaluators are even more interested in what she *learned* through the experience.

**My Demanding Winter Internship in Shenzhen** *(by Erin)*

During the winter vacation, I had a challenging senior internship at the International Information Produce Company—a joint venture company in Shenzhen. I worked in the Supply Department, which has responsibility for purchase order fulfillment, supplier relationship management, and supply performance measurements. My job was to maintain purchase orders and send them to suppliers and analyze material shortages. For 20 days I became familiar with using the company’s SAP computer system, which was designed for the whole scope of manufacturing including dropping customer orders, demand planning, engineer development, warehouse receiving/delivery, and finance payment. What I learned was focused on dropping customer orders and demand payments. Because of this difficult internship, I realized that what I have learned in school is far from enough; if I want to be able to adapt to a new working environment, I must continually increase my English level and knowledge in many fields.

2. With a partner, talk about the problems with these conclusions, and suggest ways to make them better.
   (a) So please take care of the environment.
   (b) Mr. Smith’s example should inspire you to put the customer first in your business. (or "... should inspire us all...")
3. With a partner, create an outline for Erin’s Winter Internship essay (printed above, see 1.2e). Next, pretend you are Erin’s teacher, and mark the problems in the draft (printed below). That is, use the marking symbols in appendix A to show the differences between the revised version and the draft. Do you understand the changes?

**My Winter Internship (draft—with errors)**

During the winter vocation, I had my internship in the International Information produce company—a joint venture company in Shenzhen. I worked in the Supply department, whose responsibility includes purchase orders fulfillment, supplier relationship management and supplies performance measurements. What I did in the department was maintain the purchase order and send to suppliers, analyze the material shortage. For 20 days I got familier with using the SAP system which designed for whole manufacture scope, from dropping customers order to demand planning, engineer developing, warehouse receiving/delivery and finance payment, what I learned was focused on dropping customer orders and demand payment. Because the internship I relized what I have learned in school is far unenough. If I want to adapt to the new working environment, I must increase my English level and enlarge my knowledge in every fields continually.

**(1) Rewriting practice**
Rewrite "Fun at NPU," an academic paragraph about Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi’an.

**Special instructions for all "Rewriting practice" exercises**

Throughout this book, you will be asked to rewrite assignments written by other students. We will call these "Rewriting practice" while we call your work to rewrite your own essays "revisions." To get the most from "Rewriting practice," follow this process:

1. Begin by looking carefully at the flawed assignment and the correction "hints" that follow it. See appendix A for a key to understanding the hints.
2. Rewrite the essay, trying to make it the same length as the original (or perhaps a little shorter). Unless your teacher gives different instructions, double-space all assignments that will be handed in.
3. After you have rewritten the essay, compare your work with the sample in the answer key (at the back of this book).
4. Finally, work with a classmate to cross out whatever needs to be changed, making final corrections together in the spaces above your lines.

Unless your teacher tells you to, don’t waste time rewriting your essay to get rid of the mistakes after steps 3 or 4. That way your teacher can see the process of your work.

**Fun at NPU**

Compared with middle school, there are more extra-curricular activities in university. [In my university, NPU,] the extra-curricular activities are various and colorful. [According to their own interests and hobbies], the students are involved in the activities, such as music, sports, literature, painting and drama. For example: some students are good at playing the guitar and they have no hesitation to join the Guitar Association, which gives them a good chance to show their talent and to learn more from others in their spare times. Some students like photography and they come together to share their works, opinions and feelings, in the Photography Association. These various and colorful extra-curricular activities not only give the students a good chance to show their talent and ability and also make them learn a lot of knowledge. (133 words)

**Hints:** This starts with a vague title. The first sentence is not supported, since the essay does not compare NPU to any middle school. Tell what NPU means (Northwestern Polytechnical University) before using the initials. There is no need for personal references in this essay. Put prepositional phrases at the end of sentences unless they indicate time (and use "at NPU" not "in NPU"). The article "the" is not needed in every place the student used it above (we’ll look at articles in lesson 13). The "hesitation" phrase is wordy, and it is probably based on a Chinglish translation of 没有犹豫—does the reader need to know how quickly the student joins a club? Some of the remaining problems are dealt with in the "Better Writing" sections. We don’t "learn knowledge," we "gain knowledge" (section G3a); "not only" should be followed by a "but…" clause (G5c). "Various" is not used this way; "make" means to force, so find a softer verb (see make and various in section 28.1). There are several punctuation problems, including the fact that a space is needed after a comma or period (not before). Notice that the conclusion gives an implication—that’s good! (This student’s revision was much better, and used only 115 words.)

**(1) Writing assignment A**
Write an academic paragraph about some of the changes that have taken place on your university campus (or some other place you are familiar with) in the past two or three years. Use 125 to 150 words. Double space your work and write (or type) clearly. Put this information at the top: your name (and class number), the essay’s "letter," the word count, and the due date (example: Tom (class 212), #A, 127 words, due Oct 21).

**Looking ahead:**

At the end of each lesson, the "looking ahead" section will ask you to prepare for the following lesson. First, copy the English definitions from the glossary (at the back of the book) into the vocabulary section at the end of the coming lesson. Use a dictionary if you need additional help. Then work with a partner to create sentences with at least six of the vocabulary terms. Be sure to underline the vocabulary terms in your sentences. **DO NOT copy sentences out of a dictionary—this is plagiarism** (the subject of lesson 2). Finally, it is a good idea to start memorizing how to spell the new vocabulary words, along with learning their English definitions. If you memorize ten to 15 words per week, and study them often in the weeks ahead, it will not only improve your English level but it will also make it easier to prepare for your exams.
