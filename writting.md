To help you do that, I have tried to boil down the advice of good writers and editors to some tested guidelines. There are few rules in writing many guidelines, but only a few rules. I have three rules: no blasphemy, no obscenity, and no dishonesty.

“Writing, the art of communicating thoughts to the mind through the eye, is the great invention of the world...enabling us to converse with the dead, the absent, and the unborn, at all distances of time and space.”

**Writing Skills—The Basics**

We will start by looking back. If your English level is at or above the "Band 4" level, most of the writing you have done for teachers or exams could be considered academic paragraphs or academic essays. After reviewing basic academic writing, we can build on that foundation.

The paragraph is the basic building block of any good writing. As a language student, you need this building block to answer exam essay questions, complete basic assignments, and construct larger academic essays (to be covered in lesson 4). In an academic context, a paragraph is a group of sentences presenting a single idea through connected facts, arguments, or descriptions.

**1.2a. Introduction, body and conclusion (and sample outline)**

An academic paragraph has three parts: introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction and conclusion are each one sentence long. The body should be two to four sentences. Tie your introduction, body and conclusion together by repeating the main concepts (preferably by using a similar word or phrase instead of the same wording).

Your topic sentence (i.e., your introduction) is very important because it gets the reader's attention or at least tells him/her what you will write about. Begin your paragraph with something interesting. A good topic sentence makes the reader want to read on.

Next, the body gives evidence or details that develop your point in an interesting way. We’ll talk more about this later (especially in 3.2, "How to Begin"), but for now just remember to make sure everything in your body is related to your topic sentence. To keep it interesting, use a variety of sentence structures and avoid starting multiple sentences with the same word.

Finally, conclude by summarizing your support and/or stating an important consequence or implication of your argument. Be sure to restate your topic (this does NOT mean simply repeating your topic sentence!). A good way to think of an implication is to try to answer this question from your reader's perspective: "Why does this matter to me?" While the topic sentence and conclusion contain similar information, they also need to sound different. The former previews your idea; the conclusion summarizes your idea with more details (i.e., with the support you used in the body).

**General academic paragraph (sample outline)**

- **Topic sentence**
  - The first sentence introduces the topic
- **Body of the paragraph**
  - Two or three sentences that provide support or details to develop your point
- **Summary/conclusion**
  - The final sentence summarizes your support and/or provides some important implication related to the topic sentence

**1.2b. Written versus spoken English, and things to avoid**

Remember that academic writing is different from spoken English, or even from conversational writing. In each of these, the goal is communication, but written English needs to be concise and logically organized while spoken English has much more repetition and wordiness (often in order to be courteous). Furthermore, most conversational writing seeks to influence the reader, but writers need to think of academic graders as objective observers (not personal readers). In academic writing, be sure the word *you* means "you all" not "you individually." In fact, the word *you* is much less common in academic work than in most forms of writing.

Spoken English is also more personal. Most academic work is about something you can study or describe—not personal experiences—so try to leave out personal references such as *I, my,* and *our.* For example, the topic "sports on campus" would make a better academic essay than "my favorite sport." Similarly, personal exclamations (like "What a happy group!") almost never appear in academic writing.

When you write (and especially when you write an academic topic sentence or conclusion), you also need to avoid several **vague** or polite **colloquial expressions**, including: *please, everyone knows, etc.*

- **"Please take your friends seriously and learn to..."** Please is an important and polite oral expression, but in writing you convince readers with facts and support, not politeness. Another reason to avoid *please* is because *please* means "you individually need to do something," and this personal tone is not appropriate for academic writing.
- **"As everyone knows..."** *"It is clear that..." "It is safe to say..."* This kind of vague expression does not belong in your writing for two reasons: (1) if it is "needless to say" something, then there is no need to state it, and (2) there is probably someone who doesn’t know—or doesn’t agree with—what "everybody knows." Poor writers use such phrases to make their opinions sound convincing, when they should be convincing their readers with *facts* or clear examples.
- **"Cake, candles and so on are important..."** *"Friends are something like books."* Vague terms such as "something like," "etc.," or "and so on" just make it sound like the writer doesn’t know what is important enough to write down. Learn to be more specific.

**1.2c. Writing a good title and a lean paragraph**

Writing a good *title* for your essay is hard work. It needs to be simple yet interesting. Don’t just state the topic; add a detail or two. (Compare the vague title "Birthday Celebrations" with the more informative "70th Birthday Celebrations in Zhejiang.") Most titles (other than news) do not contain verbs. The title should be something your sentences can support or explain, not a colloquial expression ("New Mood Comes with Campus Repairs" is clear, while this title says nothing: "This Place is Well on the Way"). Sometimes a thought-provoking question is appropriate (e.g., "Summer Jobs: Helpful or Harmful?"). Book and newspaper titles try to attract a reader’s attention, but a grader reading academic essays (e.g., your teacher) is looking for a thoughtfully-written summary. Leave a space between your title and first sentence; type-written titles should not be in a bigger font.
