1, I have this friend at Bloomingdales `who's quitting` tomorrow and he wants to `abuse` his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it.

2, what are you doin'? You can't going shopping with her, what about Rachel? 
It's gonna be problem, isn't it?

-----------Act III-----------

we were shopping, and we had lunch.
  no wonder I don't feel full

-----------Act IV-----------

Carol, `we've been through this` before? We have a good time. We laugh, we play, it's like we are father and son.

Rachel: this is so cute!

Carol: Oh, I `got that for him`.

......

Phoebe: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?

Ross: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it!

-----------Act V-----------

Monica: when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then `one thing to another`, before I knew it, we were ... shopping.

Rachel: Oh, Oh my god.

Monica: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.

Rachel: Yeah, right.

Monica: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.

Rachel: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.

Monica: That is not true.

Rachel: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here.

Monica: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid.

-----------Act V-----------

Phoebe: I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross `freaked out`.

Ross: I did not freak out

......

Ross: No, no, Carol, there is nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.

Chandler: Of course the packaging does `appeal to` grown-ups and kids alike.
