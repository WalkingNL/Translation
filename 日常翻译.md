小时候，尤其到了夏天，每次吃饭时特别害怕虫子掉进去。现在想起来，那个时候，空中的小飞虫总时特别多，不经意间，就已经在你的碗里了。然后我就吃不下去了。

when I was little, especially in the summer, I would always be afraid of that some gnats would fall into my bowl。I've always been thinking there were a lot of flying little gnats in the air at that time. And inadvertently, some of them would drop into your bowl. and then I would turn stomach.
