However, several Congressmen, including Owen, Lindbergh, La Follette, and Murdock claimed that the New York bankers feigned their disapproval of the bill in hopes of inducing Congress to pass it. The day before the bill was passed, Murdock told Congress: 
```
feign: pretend to be affected by (a feeling, state, or injury).

    ```
### the word `while`'s usage
#### the first usage
    The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977, which requires the Fed to direct its policies toward achieving maximum employment and price stability and report regularly to Congress. The act also required Senate confirmation for the chair and vice chair of the Board of Governors `while` limiting their terms to four years.
In this passage, the meaning of the word `while` represents what is the same meaning as the phrase `at the same time as`.


somewhat

The NBER's definition emphasizes that a recession involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months. In our interpretation of this definition, we treat the three criteria—depth, diffusion, and duration—as somewhat interchangeable.

## Grammar

prepositional phrase

1. he ran the marathon `with great determination`

        with great determination is used to modify the verb `ran`, so it is a adverbial phrase.

2. anyone can create a new pool `with a specified hook`

        with a specified hook is used to modify the noun `pool`, so it is a adjectival phrase.

how to distinguish the adverbial phrase and adjectival phrase? It is a little bit tricky. So the key point is to find out which word the phrase is used to modify based on the character of the phrase and the context of the sentence.

### `as`

e.g. why am I getting this as recommended for me today
> `as` in this sentence is used to mean `in the role, function, or status of` something.

## sentence pattern

### using participle phrase

#### participle phrase

These are phrases that begin with a participle and modify the subject of the sentence to provide more details about the action or state. They can be used to add context, clarify how an action is performed, or describe the condition of the subject during the action.

These phrases typically consist of a present participle (ending in -ing) or a past participle (often ending in -ed, -en, -d, -t, -n, or -ne) that modifies the main subject of the sentence and adds additional information about the subject’s action or state.

Here are several examples using the sentence pattern where the main subject is modified by a phrase describing the state or condition in which the subject performs an action. This structure often uses participle phrases (like "dressed in") to add more information about the subject’s appearance or state during the action:

1. **The cat sat on the mat, purring contentedly.**
   - Here, "purring contentedly" modifies "the cat," describing what the cat is doing while sitting on the mat.

2. **The children ran into the room, laughing loudly.**
   - "Laughing loudly" modifies "the children," describing how they were behaving as they ran into the room.

3. **She entered the party, dressed in a stunning red gown.**
   - "Dressed in a stunning red gown" modifies "she," indicating how she was dressed as she entered the party.

4. **The teacher stood at the front, arms crossed.**
   - "Arms crossed" modifies "the teacher," describing his posture as he stood at the front.

5. **He waited at the bus stop, shivering in the cold.**
   - "Shivering in the cold" modifies "he," describing his physical state as he waited at the bus stop.

6. **The dog lay on the porch, soaked from the rain.**
   - "Soaked from the rain" modifies "the dog," explaining the dog's condition as it lay on the porch.

7. **The students completed the test, visibly relieved.**
   - "Visibly relieved" modifies "the students," describing their emotional state as they completed the test.

These examples illustrate how participle phrases and other descriptive elements can be used to provide additional detail about the subject’s state or action in a sentence.
