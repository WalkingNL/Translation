the word "yet"

    The euro crisis demonstrated how economically and politically destabilizing it is when people lose faith in a currency. Despite periodic grumbling about the level of U.S. debt, the world has `yet` to turn its back on the dollar to a damaging degree.

if the word "yet" in this sentence is removed, the sentence will be like this:

    Despite periodic grumbling about the level of U.S. debt, the world has to turn its back on the dollar to a damaging degree.
the meaning of the sentence is changed, the word "yet" is used to emphasize the meaning of the sentence. And the word "yet" is used to mean "until now" in this sentence.
