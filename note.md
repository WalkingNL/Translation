## Grammar
prepositional phrase

1. he ran the marathon `with great determination`
    
        with great determination is used to modify the verb `ran`, so it is a adverbial phrase.

2. anyone can create a new pool `with a specified hook`

        with a specified hook is used to modify the noun `pool`, so it is a adjectival phrase.

how to distinguish the adverbial phrase and adjectival phrase? It is a little bit tricky. So the key point is to find out which word the phrase is used to modify based on the character of the phrase and the context of the sentence.

### `as`

e.g. why am I getting this as recommended for me today
> `as` in this sentence is used to mean `in the role, function, or status of` something.
