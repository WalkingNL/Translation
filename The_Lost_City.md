# The Lost City

> *An explorer’s encounter with the ruined city of Machu Picchu, the most famous icon of the Inca civilisation*

**A**
When the US explorer and academic Hiram Bingham arrived in South America in 1911, he was ready for what was to be the greatest achievement of his life: the exploration of the remote hinterland to the west of Cusco, the old capital of the Inca empire in the Andes mountains of Peru. His goal was to locate the remains of a city called Vitcos, the last capital of the Inca civilisation. Cusco lies on a high plateau at an elevation of more than 3,000 metres, and Bingham's plan was to descend from this plateau along the valley of the Urubamba river, which takes a circuitous route down to the Amazon and passes through an area of dramatic canyons and mountain ranges.

**B**
When Bingham and his team set off down the Urubamba in late July, they had an advantage over travellers who had preceded them: a track had recently been blasted down the valley canyon to enable rubber to be brought up by mules from the jungle. Almost all previous travellers had left the river at Ollantaytambo and taken a high pass across the mountains to rejoin the river lower down, thereby cutting a substantial corner, but also therefore never passing through the area around Machu Picchu.

**C**
On 24 July they were a few days into their descent of the valley. The day began slowly, with Bingham trying to arrange sufficient mules for the next stage of the trek. His companions showed no interest in accompanying him up the nearby hill to see some ruins that a local farmer, Melchor Arteaga, had told them about the night before. The morning was dull and damp, and Bingham also seems to have been less than keen on the prospect of climbing the hill. In his book *Lost City of the Incas*, he relates that he made the ascent without having the least expectation that he would find anything at the top.

**D**
Bingham writes about the approach in vivid style in his book. First, as he climbs up the hill, he describes the ever-present possibility of deadly snakes, ‘capable of making considerable springs when in pursuit of their prey’; not that he sees any. Then there’s a sense of mounting discovery as he comes across great sweeps of terraces, then a mausoleum, followed by monumental staircases and, finally, the grand ceremonial buildings of Machu Picchu. ‘It seemed like an unbelievable dream ... the sight held me spellbound ...’ he wrote.

**E**
We should remember, however, that *Lost City of the Incas* is a work of hindsight, not written until 1948, many years after his journey. His journal entries of the time reveal a much more gradual appreciation of his achievement. He spent the afternoon at the ruins noting down the dimensions of some of the buildings, then descended and rejoined his companions, to whom he seems to have said little about his discovery. At this stage, Bingham didn’t realise the extent or the importance of the site, nor did he realise what use he could make of the discovery.

**F**
However, soon after returning it occurred to him that he could make a name for himself from this discovery. When he came to write the *National Geographic* magazine article that **broke the story** to the world in April 1913, he knew he had to produce a big idea. He wondered whether it could have been the birthplace of the very first Inca, Manco the Great, and whether it could also have been what chroniclers described as ‘the last city of the Incas’. This term refers to Vilcabamba, the settlement where the Incas had fled from Spanish invaders in the 1530s. Bingham made **desperate** attempts to prove this belief for nearly 40 years. Sadly, his vision of the site as both the beginning and end of the Inca civilisation, while a magnificent one, is inaccurate. We now know that Vilcabamba actually lies 65 kilometres away in the depths of the jungle.

**G**
One question that has perplexed visitors, historians and archaeologists alike ever since Bingham, is why the site seems to have been abandoned before the Spanish Conquest. There are no references to it by any of the Spanish chroniclers — and if they had known of its existence so close to Cusco they would certainly have come in search of gold. An idea which has gained wide acceptance over the past few years is that Machu Picchu was a *moya*, a country estate built by an Inca emperor to escape the cold winters of Cusco, where the elite could enjoy monumental architecture and spectacular views. Furthermore, the particular architecture of Machu Picchu suggests that it was constructed at the time of the greatest of all the Incas, the emperor Pachacuti (c. 1438–71). By custom, Pachacuti’s descendants built other similar estates for their own use, and so Machu Picchu would have been abandoned after his death, some 50 years before the Spanish Conquest.

**A** 1911年，当美国探险家兼学者海勒姆·宾厄姆抵达南美时，他已为即将成为其一生最伟大成就的探索做好了准备：探索位于秘鲁安第斯山脉库斯科古代印加帝国首都以西的偏远腹地。他的目标是找到一个名为维尔科斯的城市遗址，这是印加文明最后的首都。库斯科位于一个海拔超过3000米的高原上，宾厄姆的计划是沿着乌鲁班巴河谷从这个高原下降，乌鲁班巴河沿着一条迂回曲折的路线流向亚马逊，途经一片陡峭的峡谷和山脉区域。

**B** 当宾厄姆及其团队在七月下旬沿着乌鲁班巴河出发时，他们比之前的旅行者拥有一个优势：一条小路最近被炸开，沿着峡谷延伸，以便用骡子将橡胶从丛林中运出来。几乎所有之前的旅行者都在奥兰泰坦博离开了这条河，然后穿过山脉的高山口，再次在较低处与河流汇合，从而切掉了相当大的一段路，但也因此从未经过马丘比丘附近的区域。

**C**
7月24日，他们已经在山谷中下行了几天。这一天开始得很慢，宾厄姆正试图为旅程的下一阶段安排足够的骡子。他的同伴们对陪他爬上附近的山丘去看当地农民梅尔乔尔·阿尔特亚加前一天晚上告诉他们的一些遗址毫无兴趣。这天早晨阴沉而潮湿，宾厄姆似乎也对爬这座山的前景不太感兴趣。在他的书《印加帝国的失落之城》中，他提到自己在攀登时并没有抱太大希望能在山顶找到什么。

**D**
宾厄姆在他的书中以生动的风格描写了这段经历。首先，当他爬上山时，他描述了致命毒蛇的潜在威胁，这些蛇“能够在追捕猎物时跳跃很远”；尽管他并没有看到任何蛇。然后，他感到越来越多的发现感，先是看到大片的梯田，接着是一个陵墓，随后是宏伟的阶梯，最后是马丘比丘的盛大礼仪建筑。“这似乎像一个难以置信的梦境……这一景象让我如痴如醉……”他写道。

**E**
然而，我们应该记住，**《印加帝国的失落之城》**是一部后见之明的作品，直到1948年才写成，那已经是他探险多年之后的事了。他当时的日记记录显示了他对这一成就的认识是逐渐加深的。他在遗址上度过了一个下午，记录下了一些建筑的尺寸，然后下山重新与他的同伴会合，似乎并没有对他们谈论太多他的发现。在这个阶段，宾厄姆并没有意识到遗址的规模或重要性，也没有意识到他能如何利用这一发现。

**F**
然而，回国不久后，他意识到自己可以通过这一发现扬名立万。当他为**《国家地理杂志》**撰写文章并于1913年4月向全世界公布这一消息时，他知道自己必须提出一个重要的想法。他想知道这是否可能是第一位印加帝王曼科大帝的诞生地，以及这是否可能是史书记载的“印加人的最后一座城市”。这个词指的是维尔卡班巴，这是1530年代印加人逃离西班牙入侵者的定居点。宾厄姆近40年来拼命地想要证明这一信念。可惜的是，他认为这个遗址既是印加文明的开端也是终点，尽管这个想法很宏伟，但却是不准确的。我们现在知道，维尔卡班巴实际上位于丛林深处，距离这里有65公里。

**G**
自从宾厄姆以来，一个困扰游客、历史学家和考古学家的问题是，为什么这个遗址似乎在西班牙征服之前就被废弃了。西班牙编年史中没有任何对它的提及——如果他们知道如此靠近库斯科的地方存在这个遗址，他们肯定会为了寻找黄金而来。过去几年间，一种广泛接受的观点是，马丘比丘是一座*莫亚*（moya），一座由印加皇帝建造的乡村庄园，用来避开库斯科的寒冷冬季，在这里，精英阶层可以享受宏伟的建筑和壮丽的景色。此外，马丘比丘的特殊建筑风格表明，它建造于所有印加皇帝中最伟大的帕查库特（约1438-71年）时期。按照惯例，帕查库特的后裔为自己建造了其他类似的庄园，因此在他去世后，马丘比丘大约在西班牙征服之前50年就被废弃了。

**to break the story**

In the sentence "When he came to write the National Geographic magazine article that **broke the story** to the world in April 1913," the word **broke** is used to describe the action of revealing or making a story known to the public for the first time.

### Explanation:

- **"Broke the story"** is an idiomatic expression in journalism. It means to be the first to report or reveal significant news to the public. The verb **broke** is the past tense of "break," and in this context, it conveys that the article was the first to make the news widely known.
- **"Broke"** in this sentence refers to the action of publicizing or disseminating the news on a large scale.

So, the sentence is saying that the National Geographic article was the first to inform the world about the story in April 1913.
