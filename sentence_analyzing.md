1. To start, we first examine the market reaction and usage of Tornado Cash contracts `around` the sanction announcement.

    > `around` refers to the `before, during, after` time frame.

2. We document a sharp immediate reaction to the sanction announcement `by` Tornado Cash stakeholders.

    > `by` is commonly used to indicate the agent in active or passive constructions. Without `by`, the sentence would lose the specific information about who had the reaction.

3. The total market value of TORN, the governance token for Tornado Cash, `drops by` about 60 percent from its local peak reached a day prior to the announcement, and overall a 33 percent `drop` around a 4-week window.

4. Correspondingly, actual Tornado Cash transactions, both by volumes and value, significantly decline, with transaction volume across various pools dropping by about 72 percent.

   - Adverbial Modifier (Introduction):
     - “Correspondingly”:
        > Functions as an introductory adverb. Indicates a connection or alignment with something previously mentioned (e.g., it follows logically or as a response to earlier events or data).

   - Main Clause:
     - “Actual Tornado Cash transactions, both by volumes and value, significantly decline”:
        > This is the main clause of the sentence and contains the core information. Subject: “Actual Tornado Cash transactions”. Describes what is being discussed (specific transactions involving Tornado Cash).

	    > Appositive (additional information): “both by volumes and value” provides clarification about how the transactions are being measured or analyzed.

        > Verb: “significantly decline”. Describes the action (a substantial decrease in the transactions).

   - Subordinate Clause (introduced by “with”):
     - “with transaction volume across various pools dropping by about 72 percent”:
	    > This is a subordinate clause that provides additional information about the decline mentioned in the main clause. 
        
        > “With”: Functions as a conjunction, introducing the subordinate clause that elaborates on the nature of the decline.
	
        > Subject: “transaction volume across various pools”
        
            Refers to a specific aspect of Tornado Cash transactions (volume in different pools).

	    > Verb: “dropping”
        
            Describes the specific decrease in transaction volume.

        > Complement: “by about 72 percent”
        
            Indicates the extent or magnitude of the decline.

    > Explanation:

    The sentence first establishes the decline in Tornado Cash transactions as the main point, then elaborates on the magnitude of the decline with specific data (72 percent drop). The “with” clause adds a deeper insight into the nature of the decline, providing details on how the transactions were affected across various pools.

    This structure is effective for presenting a general statement (decline in transactions) and then supporting it with specific evidence (72 percent decrease).
